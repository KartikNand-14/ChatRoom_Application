# ChatRoom_Application
This project is a real-time chatroom application consisting of a server and client implementation. The chatroom allows multiple clients to connect, exchange messages, and engage in live conversations. It enables users to join the chatroom, communicate with each other, and gracefully leave the chatroom when they choose to.
